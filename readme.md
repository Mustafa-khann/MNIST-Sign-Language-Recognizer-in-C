# MNIST Sign Language Recognizer

## Project Overview

This project is focused on building a neural network from scratch in C to recognize sign language alphabets and digits using the MNIST dataset for sign language. The project involves creating a simple feedforward neural network that can perform image classification tasks, specifically recognizing hand-written sign language characters.

### Description of Each Component

1. **`src/` Directory**: Contains all the source code files for the project.
   - `main.c`: The entry point of the application, which sets up and runs the neural network.
   - `network.c`, `network.h`: Implements the neural network, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and network initialization.
   - `data_loader.c`, `data_loader.h`: Handles loading and preprocessing of the MNIST sign language dataset.
   - `matrix.c`, `matrix.h`: Provides matrix operations essential for neural network computations (e.g., matrix multiplication, addition).

2. **`data/` Directory**: Contains the dataset files used for training and testing.
   - `sign_mnist_train.csv`: Training data.
   - `sign_mnist_test.csv`: Testing data.

3. **`Makefile`**: A Makefile for compiling the project using `make` for easy build and execution.

4. **`README.md`**: This file provides a comprehensive guide on how to use and understand the project.

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mustafa-khann/mnist-sign-language-recognizer.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Tools**: Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`) and `make`.

3. **Download the Dataset**: Place the `sign_mnist_train.csv` and `sign_mnist_test.csv` files into the `data/` directory. These files can be downloaded from Kaggle or any other trusted source that provides the MNIST sign language dataset.

4. **Build the Project**: Use the Makefile to compile the project.

   ```bash
   cd mnist-sign-language-recognizer
   make
   ```

## Running the Project

After building the project, you can run the executable to train and test the neural network:

```bash
./mnist-sign-language-recognizer
```

This will start training the neural network using the training dataset and then evaluate its performance on the testing dataset.

## Understanding the Code

1. **Matrix Operations (`matrix.c`, `matrix.h`)**: Defines functions for creating, freeing, and performing operations on matrices, such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, and applying activation functions.

2. **Neural Network (`network.c`, `network.h`)**:
   - **Network Creation**: Initializes a neural network with specified layers and sizes.
   - **Forward Propagation**: Implements the forward pass of the neural network, calculating activations.
   - **Backpropagation**: Implements the backward pass, adjusting weights and biases based on errors.
   - **Activation Functions**: Uses the sigmoid function and its derivative for neuron activation and gradient calculations.

3. **Data Loader (`data_loader.c`, `data_loader.h`)**: Reads CSV files, normalizes the data, and prepares it for training and testing.

4. **Main (`main.c`)**: The driver of the program. It loads the data, initializes the network, runs training for a specified number of epochs, and evaluates the model's performance.

## Next Steps

- **Optimize Backpropagation**: Enhance the backpropagation implementation for better performance and accuracy.
- **Implement Additional Features**: Add more sophisticated features like different activation functions, more layers, dropout, etc.
- **Refactor Code**: Organize the codebase for better modularity and maintainability.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic but comprehensive implementation of a neural network for image classification using C. By following the steps and exploring the code, you gain a deeper understanding of neural network internals and the challenges of implementing such models from scratch. This is a powerful learning experience for anyone interested in the intersection of machine learning and low-level programming.
