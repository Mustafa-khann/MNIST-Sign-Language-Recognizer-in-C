# MNIST Sign Language Recognizer in C

Harness the power of neural networks to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) digits with this high-performance C implementation. This project utilizes a custom dataset based on MNIST to train and test a neural network capable of identifying hand gestures, providing a foundation for future development in the realm of gesture recognition and human-computer interaction.
